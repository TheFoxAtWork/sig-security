# [Project Name] Security Evaluation Survey

This survey is designed to gather feedback from project members and security
reviewers to determine the effectiveness, quality, and overall success of the
security evaluation process.  It may be used by projects during the
self-assessment or joint evaluation and should be completed at then end.

## Value

1. *Did the project team find the security evaluation process valuable to the
   security stature of the project?*


2. *Did the reviewers find the security evaluation process valuable to
   establishing and evaluating the current security health of the project?*


3. *What was the most valuable artifact or portion of the process?*


## Quality

1. *Is the quality of the security evaluation artifacts on par with previous
   security evaluations (formerly assessments)?*


2. *For self-assessments, was the self-assessment content helpful for
   assisting in the security documentation of the project?*

## Efficiency

1. *Were there parts of the security evaluation process that could be improved,
   such as timeliness, communication, etc.?*


2. *Are portions of the artifacts produced from this evaluation duplicate, or better left as references
   elsewhere?*

3. *For joint evaluations, if a self-assessment was performed prior to the joint
   evaluation, was the self-assessment beneficial for the creation of the joint
evaluation?*

## Other

1.  *Would you recommend other projects receive a security evaluation?*


2.  *What areas of the security evaluation process (templates, instructions,
    etc.) can be improved to make the experience and resulting artifacts more
useful or desirable?*


3.  *What additional feedback do you have?*
